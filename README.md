# ParserService

Originally authored by Donald Jones.

# What it does:

This Git project provides a webservice which allows parsers to be written that convert flat text files into interactive message sequence charts (MSCs).

Supported MSC objects are made up of either:

- messages between two nodes

- events which take place on a particular node. These can be assigned a severity which will control the fill colour for that event.

- state changes (Similar to an event, but with additional metadata relating to the trigger for the state change)

- spanning boxes. There work like events, but span between two nodes.

All interactions can be allocated a timestamp and / or tags, which can be used to differentiate interactions occurring in parallel, e.g. call IDs.

For a given parser it is possible to configure a particular order of nodes, via a <parser>/config.xml file

# Target pages:

[Parser entry page](http://localhost:5000/) - Allows selection of a parser to run against the input text file, and also upload of the file in question.

# Interactions:

Once a message sequence chart has been generated, there are multiple interactions which can be achieved:

Click on the MSC event line number will jump back to the line number of the original flat text file.

Click on the graphical event itself will (by default) take you to the line number of the original text file. Alternatively, for a given parser it could take you to an optional URL if appropriate.

There is also the ability to filter the events visible in the MSC by either:

- the node that they are attached to

- the tag of the event.

# Parser types:

simple - by using a basic notation it is possible to easily build simple MSCs

sip_msg - example MSC which is generated by parsing a wireshark text export, specifically focussing on SIP messaging flows.
